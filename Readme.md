## Geochemical Clustering
Data analytical clustering project targeting the Lhoist quary site Tapah, Malaysia.

The pipeline consist of three jupyter notebooks:
- Querying the data from an internal SQL database and saving it to a CSV file
- Cleaning, filtering and sorting the data to suit the specific requirements
- Clustering the data points based on their geochemical analysis and exporting a refined result dataset

### Used Algorithms:
- Scaling: Robust Scaling
- Chemical Clustering: Affinity Propagation
